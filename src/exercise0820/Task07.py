# ### Task #7
# âœ… Leap Year Checker:
# Create a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year.
# A leap year is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.
# Use an if-else statement to make this determination

#logic year/4==0 year/100 or year/400
year=int(input("Enter a year:\t"))
if year%4==0 or (year%100!=0 and year%400==0):
    print(f"{year} is a Leap year")
else:
    print(f"{year} is Not a leap year")
